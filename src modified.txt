Problem:
 Create REST endpoint that return the sum of a list of numbers e.g. [1,2,3] => 1+2+3 = 6
The list of numbers is expected to arrive from a backend service and for this test you can
hard code the list using the following line.
numbers_to_add = list(range(10000001))
The url of the endpoint and the sample response is as follows:
Request: http://localhost:5000/total
Response:
{
"total": 6
}
Source code:
from flask import Flask, jsonify,request
##creating a Flask app 

app = Flask(__name__)

##A simple function to calculate the sum ofa list of a numbers

def sum_list(end):
    sum=0
    for i in range(end+1):
        sum +=i
    return sum


@app.route("/total")
def total():
    numbers_to_add = list(range(10000001))
    return jsonify(total=sum_list(numbers_to_add[5]))

    app.run()
